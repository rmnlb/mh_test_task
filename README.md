## React/Redux test task (pagination)

### About app:

- Gets data (list of users) from JSON and store it 
in redux store.
- Generates a page with 5 users with info and photo.
- Dynamic pagination nav builds depends on users total amount.
- App after reloading stays at the same page as before reload 
(localStorage, not react-router).

You can run ```npm run start``` in ```test-task``` folder in the console for checking app, 
or make production (optimized) build by running ```npm run build```
